## About the app

This app was created as a practical exercise for unit and e2e testing. Git's commits have been structured to follow a clear progression. We will use this application to step through intersting topics of test-automation to learn with an example the do's (and sometimes dont's) of how testing works.

First up: adding jest and removing jasmine and karma.
